## Project Description

> VocabularyCLI is a lightweight Command Line Interface that allows users to look up word definitions, examples, synonyms and antonyms directly via the command line. Powered with several utility based commands our CLI offers rapid and robust Knowledge Base capabilites like Flashcards, Tagging, Word Management, Graph Reporting, Bulk import and export of word lists and is a definitive software for linguaphiles. 
>
> This application boasts a simple and intuitive interface that is easy to use and is a must have for anyone who wants to expand their vocabulary and improve their language skills. The app also offers advanced Text Classification and Processing via the use of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning algorithms which will be discussed in detail in the "Scope and Features" section.
>
> The CLI will be offered with eye-catching Panels, Tables, Animated Symbols, Emojis, Interactive Menus, Spinners, Colored fonts and other rich features that will make the user experience more enjoyable and interactive. The CLI will also be offered with a comprehensive User Manual and a detailed Documentation that will help users get started with the CLI and use it to its full potential.
