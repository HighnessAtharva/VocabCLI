# List of Possible Viva Questions with Solutions

### Why a CLI and not a GUI?
> VocabCLI is lightweight, fancy and accessible. It does not use much system resources and allows large scale processing of words within seconds. CLIs allow for a more productive and flexible software. Eg. For a Dictionary GUI application, designing, module management and unit testing is time-consuming and error prone but the same utility function can be achieved via CLI much faster and time spent in developing GUI elements is much better utilized in improving and adding new functionality and making a feature-rich product. GUIs need a lot of rework when new features are to be added and become cluttered but CLI tools do not need graphical resdesign nor clutter up as the list of functions keeps on growing.
