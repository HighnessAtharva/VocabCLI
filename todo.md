We need to do error handling everywhere where user is typing incorrect input (example:wrong tag/ date/ days, etc)

Test cases for all the functions I have commented as:
#no tests for this function as it is not called anywhere in the command directly

Test cases for all other commands like:
history
about
revise
quiz
random

We should rename unlearn to not-learning
