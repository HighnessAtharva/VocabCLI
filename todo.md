We need to do error handling everywhere where user is typing invalid input (example:str for int for wise versa)
We need to do error handling everywhere where user is typing incorrect input (example:wrong tag/ date/ days, etc)
Need to do error handling where user is typing negative integer instead of positive
Need to write test cases for all the functions/commands with error handling one's 

---

Test cases for all the functions I have commented as:
#no tests for this function as it is not called anywhere in the command directly

---

Test cases for all other commands like:
history
about
banner
graph
revise
quiz
refresh cache
text report
export pdf
export csv


---

Find more commands/ functions which have been missed in testing.
All test cases of each functions should be covered, pls suggest scenarios
I wrote for list days and list last, I guess those are ideal.

We should rename delete to remove
We should rename unnlearn to something else
